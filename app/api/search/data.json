        "about_us": "ITT Bornemann from Obernkirchen, Germany, has a long history of success as shown in Bornemann's timeline. Since the company was founded in 1853, our goal has been to respond to markets with products and solutions that are technologically outstanding and cost-effective. From that point on, Bornemann has been setting the pace. In 1934, for example, it patented the Twin-Screw Pump with external bearings. In the 1960s, the development of the triple-screw pump and the Progressive Cavity Pump led to more innovative solutions, and in the 1980s, Bornemann's multiphase pumps created commercial opportunities that had been previously unthinkable. Our manufacturing focus nowadays focuses on the twin-screw pumps.\n\nA superior command of technology in nearly all areas of application has made Bornemann a worldwide leader in its field. Sales offices and subsidiaries worldwide ensure that there is immediate and professional support throughout all phases of the production process ranging from detailed advice extending to tailor-made engineering and finally including reliable maintenance of the installed pumps and systems. Efficiency, reliability and a high level of availability are the most important features that distinguish Bornemann pumps and systems."
